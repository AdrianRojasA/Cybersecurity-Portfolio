# Wireshark - Analyze Your FIrst Packet 

## Scenario

In this scenario, you’re a security analyst investigating traffic to a website.

You’ll analyze a network packet capture file that contains traffic data related to a user connecting to an internet site. The ability to filter network traffic using packet sniffers to gather relevant information is an essential skill as a security analyst.

You must filter the data in order to:
1. Identify the source and destination IP addresses involved in this web browsing session.
2. Examine the protocols that are used when the user makes the connection to the website.
3. Analyze some of the data packets to identify the type of information sent and received by the systems that connect to each other when the network data is captured.

Here’s how you’ll do this: 
1. First, you’ll open the packet capture file and explore the basic Wireshark graphic user interface.
2. Second, you’ll open a detailed view of a single packet and explore how to examine the various protocol and data layers inside a network packet.
3. Third, you’ll apply filters to select and inspect packets based on specific criteria.
4. Fourth, you’ll filter and inspect UDP DNS traffic to examine protocol data.
5. Finally, you’ll apply filters to TCP packet data to search for specific payload text data.

An overview of the key property columns listed for each packet: 
* No. : The index number of the packet in this packet capture file
* Time: The timestamp of the packet
* Source: The source IP address
* Destination: The destination IP address
* Protocol: The protocol contained in the packet
* Length: The total length of the packet
* Info: Some infomation about the data in the packet (the payload) as interpreted by Wireshark

## Solutions 
1. Identify the source and destination IP addresses involved in this web browsing session.
* On the title bar, type `ip.addr == 142.250.1.139` to filter for traffic associated with a specific IP address. Select the first packet that contains `TCP` on the info field. `addr` means either the source or the destination IP.

* On the title bar, type `ip.src == 142.250.1.139` to filter for traffic associated with a specific IP address. `src` means it is where the packet comes from.

* On the title bar, type `ip.dst == 142.250.1.139` to filter for traffic associated with a specific IP address. `dst` means it is where the packet goes to.

* On the title bar, type `eth.addr == 42:01:ac:15:e0:02` to filter for traffic associated with a specific Ethernet MAC address. `addr` means either the source or the destination IP. 

2. Examine the protocols that are used when the user makes the connection to the website.
* The TCP destination port of this TCP packet is 80 which contains the initial web request to an HTPP website that will typically be listening on TCP port 80.
