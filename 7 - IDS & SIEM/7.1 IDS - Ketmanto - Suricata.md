# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) - Suricata
> Suricata is an open-source intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and network analysis tool.

There are three ways Suricata can be used: 
1. Intrusion detection system (IDS): Monitor network traffic and alert on suspicious activities and intrusions. In a practical way, it can be a host-based IDS to monitor system and network activities of a single host like a computer.
2. Intrusion prevention system (IPS): Detect and block malicious activity and traffic. It requires additional configuration such as enabling IPS mode.
3. Network security monitoring (NSM): Produce and save relevant network logs (live network traffic, existing packet capture files, full or conditional packet captures). This is beneficial for forensics, incident response and for testing signatures.

Suricata uses signatures analysis, which is a detection method used to find events of interest. Signatures consist of three components:
1. Action: The first component of a signature. It describes the action to take if network or system activity matches the signature. Examples include: alert, pass, drop, or reject.
2. Header: The header includes network traffic information like source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, protocol, and traffic direction.
3. Rule options: The rule options provide you with different options to customize signatures.
