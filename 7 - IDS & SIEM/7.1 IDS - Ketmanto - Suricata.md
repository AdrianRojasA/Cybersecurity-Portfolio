# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) - Suricata
> Suricata is an open-source intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and network analysis tool.

## Overview
There are three ways Suricata can be used: 
1. Intrusion detection system `(IDS)`: Monitor network traffic and alert on suspicious activities and intrusions. In a practical way, it can be a host-based IDS to monitor system and network activities of a single host like a computer.
2. Intrusion prevention system `(IPS)`: Detect and block malicious activity and traffic. It requires additional configuration such as enabling IPS mode.
3. Network security monitoring `(NSM)`: Produce and save relevant network logs (live network traffic, existing packet capture files, full or conditional packet captures). This is beneficial for forensics, incident response and for testing signatures.

Suricata uses signatures analysis, which is a detection method used to find events of interest. Signatures consist of three components:
1. Action: The first component of a signature. It describes the action to take if network or system activity matches the signature. Examples include: alert, pass, drop, or reject.
2. Header: The header includes network traffic information like source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, protocol, and traffic direction.
3. Rule options: The rule options provide you with different options to customize signatures.

## Examine alerts, logs and rules with Suricata 

In this scenario, you’re a security analyst who must monitor traffic on your employer's network. You’ll be required to configure Suricata and use it to trigger alerts.

Here’s how you'll do this task: First, you'll explore custom rules in Suricata. Second, you'll run Suricata with a custom rule in order to trigger it, and examine the output logs in the fast.log file. Finally, you’ll examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the standard eve.json log file.

For the purposes of the tests you’ll run in this lab activity, you’ve been supplied with a sample.pcap file and a custom.rules file. These reside in your home folder.

Let’s define the files you’ll be working with in this lab activity:

1. The `sample.pcap` file is a packet capture file that contains an example of network traffic data, which you’ll use to test the Suricata rules. This will allow you to simulate and repeat the exercise of monitoring network traffic.
  
2. The `custom.rules` file contains a custom rule when the lab activity starts. You’ll add rules to this file and run them against the network traffic data in the sample.pcap file.

3. The `fast.log` file will contain the alerts that Suricata generates. The fast.log file is empty when the lab starts. Each time you test a rule, or set of rules, against the sample network traffic data, Suricata adds a new alert line to the fast.log file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met. The fast.log file can be located in the /var/log/suricata directory after Suricata runs.The fast.log file is considered to be a depreciated format and is not recommended for incident response or threat hunting tasks but can be used to perform quick checks or tasks related to quality assurance.

4. The `eve.json` file is the main, standard, and default log for events generated by Suricata. It contains detailed information about alerts triggered, as well as other network telemetry events, in JSON format. The eve.json file is generated when Suricate runs, and can also be located in the /var/log/suricata directory.

When you create a new rule, you'll need to test the rule to confirm whether or not it worked as expected. You can use the fast.log file to quickly compare the number of alerts generated each time you run Suricata to test a signature against the sample.pcap file.

## Expectation 

* Create custom rules and run them in Suricata.
* Monitor traffic captured in a packet capture file.
* Examine the fast.log and eve.json output.

## Steps 

1. Examine a custom rule in Suricata
