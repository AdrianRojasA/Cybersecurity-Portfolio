# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Analyze Network Layer Communication

Please enroll to the Google Cybersecurity [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/networks-and-network-security?specialization=google-cybersecurity) on Coursera to view other attachments to solve this task. I only uploaded my answer to it. 

## Identify the type of attack that may have caused this network interruption 

One potential explanation for the website's connection timeout error message is: DOS attack. <br>
The logs show that: Web server stops responding after receiving so many SYN packet requests. <br>
This event could be: Syn flood attack.

## Part 2: Explain how the attack is causing the website malfunction 
When website visitors try to establish a connection with the web server, a three-way handshake occurs using the TCP protocol. Explain the three steps of the handshake: 

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | `SYN` : Client sends SYN packet to the server, requesting a connection. |
| 2 | `SYN/ACK` : Server responds with SYN/ACK packet, acknowledging the client's SYN and requesting confirmation of the connection. |
| 3 | `ACK` : Client sends ACK packet to the server, acknowledging the server's SYN/ACK. |

Explain what happens when a malicious actor sends a large number of SYN packets all at once: It slows down the traffic to the point where such request will fail to be executed. It overwhelms the serverâ€™s available resources to reserve for the connection. When this happens, there are no server resources left for legitimate TCP connection requests. <br>
Explain what the logs indicate and how that affects the server: The server has become overloaded and unable to receive any more visitors. In addition, those new visitors will receive a connection timeout message.
