# Ketmanto-Cybersecurity-Portfolio

## Professional Statements
I am Ketmanto Wangsa. I am a Warehouse Assistant with four years of experience in the transport industry and nearly two years in the retail sector. I completed the Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. As part of my internship at a leading US supplier, I had the opportunity to serve as both Technical Support and Team Leader of the Sourcing Team. Furthermore, I completed the IBM Engagement Specialist program to enhance my interpersonal skills.

The Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate have prepared me for industry-ready jobs. My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats. As of now, I am preparing to take the CompTIA A+ and CompTIA Security+ certifications.
